This is our cs 207 project
Our software control component for four wheel drive robot car will be using Arduino
sketch. The software will allow the robot receive instructions from user such as moving
forward,backward,left and right, via bluetooth component. After received instructions, the
software will send commands to order the next move of the robot depends on the instructions.
The idea is the software control four different motors independently, so when user give
instruction like moving forward only two motor which set forward will move and so on. The
turn left and right process will be possible by reduce voltage on the corresponding instruction.
The circuit will demonstrate in fritzing first, that will save us a lot of effort.
